# booksCrawl

This is a pure scrapy project based on a book website. I loved and enjoyed working on this because I learned how to play around with the LinkExtractors.

LinkExtractors is such a sexy feature in the framework. You write the rules you want the crawl to follow and ..  WALA!! magic.

I programed the crawl to follow a set of rules such as where to crawl and follow and where the parseback occurs.

Data on site was extracted successfully by yeilding into a dictionary and storing it into a CSV file.
